Data directory structure: NCL-SM consist of two directories (i) IMC & (ii) IF. Each of these have 8 directories, the names of the these should explain the content, the three directories with abbrivated names i.e. 'Mask_All_AM' refer to instance segmentation mask of all analysable myofibres, 'Mask_AM_vs_NAM' refer to class mass of analysable vs non-analysable mayofibres and 'Mask_QA' refer to segmentation mask of quality assurance duplicate annotations.
